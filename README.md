# MafiaCraft

<p>MafiaCraft is a plugin for Bukkit that recreates the classic hidden role game
Mafia (also played under the name Werewolf) into Minecraft. This plugin was heavily inspired by those
games, as well as other online hidden role games like Town of Salem.</p>
<p>This plugin is still early in development, and I only really get time to work on it when my schedule
is free for a whole afternoon, so expect lengthy delays. See the status above for more info.</p>

# Gameplay
